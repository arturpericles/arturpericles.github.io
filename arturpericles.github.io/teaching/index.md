# Advising (Yale students)

I have supervised graduate and undergraduate students working on AI governance—and I would happy to support others! Do [get in touch](mailto:artur.monteiro+advising@yale.edu) if you think we could work together. Share something about your interests, and I would be glad to set up a conversation to understand if I can help.
