    "text": "Art is a Resident Fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project and the Schmidt Visiting Scholar on AI and Lecturer in Global Affairs at the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs.\nHe has researched AI and platform governance, as well as privacy and data protection. The Berkeley Technology Law Journal and the Journal of Free Speech Law feature his articles. He has presented his research at the Privacy Law Scholars Conference, the Freedom of Expression Scholars Conference, the Platform Governance Network Conference, and Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute’s symposium on free speech and misinformation.\nAt Yale, he has taught Global Law and Policy of AI (Yale Law School & Jackson School of Global Affairs) and Technology, Security, and Power (Yale College, Computer Science). He advises graduate and undergraduate students working on AI governance, and served as a Faculty Delegation Leader for the Yale–Renmin Student Dialogue on AI, Emerging Technology, and U.S.-China Relations. Art edits YLS’s ISP Digital Future Whitepaper Series, and convened the Governing Algorithms Workshop and the AI Workshop.\nBefore Yale, Art was Head of Research at InternetLab. He continues collaborating with civil society. An independent legal opinion he authored for nonprofit Ekō informs the largest-ever case on data protection in Brazil. He has served as an expert for Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net report. He has been invited to address the United Nation’s Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Organization of American States’ Office of the Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression. Previously, he was a law clerk and practiced in Brazil, advising technology companies on data protection and intellectual property."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This article revisits the “crypto wars” and the recurrent debates over exceptional access to encrypted data. From the Clipper Chip to Apple’s San Bernardino confrontation and beyond, policymakers and technologists traditionally framed encryption as a clash between privacy and security. Recent scholarship, however, reframes the conflict as one of security vs. security, emphasizing that undermining encryption weakens the very systems on which state and individual safety depend. Building on this reframing, the article surveys and critically evaluates proposals for “lawful surveillance protocols,” which attempt to reconcile privacy and law enforcement needs through cryptographic design. It argues that the prevailing conception of privacy as security, while strategically powerful, is incomplete. The article shows that a purely security-centered account fails to capture what is at stake in encryption regulation. It concludes that a fuller articulation of the right to privacy is needed to guide future debates and technical research."

It was once the subject of intense theoretical disputations; a pragmatic turn thrust it into the spotlight of the most salient disputes about the regulation of technology, surveillance, and informational capitalism. Yet at the same time that privacy law’s reach has become vast, there is no agreement on whether and how it can actually provide the answers that society expects to the most pressing questions of our days. If anything, the agreement increasingly seems to be that it can’t. The most exciting paths now being chartered instead are perhaps best read as moving “beyond privacy” and towards “data governance”. This chapter tracks this trajectory of the right to privacy, focusing on informational privacy. It raises questions we might want to answer before abandoning it as an old toy and discusses potential problems and limitations for data governance."

Scalable oversight in model design addresses those issues. It starts from the premise that, as models grow more capable, direct human judgment becomes less effective. In short, human supervision will not scale. The strategy is to enlist AI to oversee AI while keeping humans in control. The key is a hierarchy of models: less capable, more interpretable systems that developers can understand and use to evaluate stronger models.\nWe contribute to this discussion by asking how law can respond to and capitalize on scalable oversight. We outline what scalable regulatory oversight could look like in emerging regimes. We examine whether scalable oversight can complement or supplement human-in-the-loop requirements, which are now framed as direct human review. Finally, we show how scalable oversight can mitigate the information and resource deficits that have driven regulators to adopt corporate risk management approaches."

Eliminate platform power (Texas’ approach, at display in Moody) and jeopardize user speech, or resign to platform rule and seek to improve it (the EU’s influential approach).\nTo thread through this dilemma, we can learn from the structural constitution—and conquer power by dividing it. Answer platform power, this Article argues, by building collective user power. It calls for using regulatory subsidies to redistribute, to user communities, authority now enjoyed by companies. The Article shows that countervailing power is key to understanding that the First Amendment is not categorically anti-redistributive. Instead, properly understood, it scrutinizes redistribution to preserve the independence of public opinion— the people’s “censorial power”, which the First Amendment itself counters against government power.\nAs a prototype of countervailing platform power, this Article offers federalism. Governance is split into platform-wide (“federal”) and community (“state”) tiers. User communities gain primary authority over content policies and amplification priorities, as well as interface design. Platforms keep limited, enumerated powers over system-wide concerns and specified violations. A platform compact achieved through collective bargaining between users and platforms sets the boundaries. The resulting framework allows for lawful-content limitations legitimate as expressions of user deliberation, while addressing dangerous and toxic renegade communities. The model is not a silver bullet for content moderation, but it allows decisions to be made without concentrated political power in the hands of a few company executives."

As such, whether identification will contribute to a more truth-based public discourse and to a more civic-minded digital sphere is a question that can only be answered if we account for those factors.
