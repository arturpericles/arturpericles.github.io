    "text": "Art is a Resident Fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project and the Schmidt Visiting Scholar on AI and Lecturer in Global Affairs at the Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs.\nHe has researched AI and platform governance, as well as privacy and data protection. The Berkeley Technology Law Journal and the Journal of Free Speech Law feature his articles. He has presented his research at the Privacy Law Scholars Conference, the Freedom of Expression Scholars Conference, the Platform Governance Network Conference, and Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute’s symposium on free speech and misinformation.\nAt Yale, he has taught Global Law and Policy of AI (Yale Law School & Jackson School of Global Affairs) and Technology, Security, and Power (Yale College, Computer Science). He advises graduate and undergraduate students working on AI governance, and served as a Faculty Delegation Leader for the Yale–Renmin Student Dialogue on AI, Emerging Technology, and U.S.-China Relations. Art edits YLS’s ISP Digital Future Whitepaper Series, and convened the Governing Algorithms Workshop and the AI Workshop.\nBefore Yale, Art was Head of Research at InternetLab. He continues collaborating with civil society. He has served as an expert for Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net report. An independent legal opinion he authored for nonprofit Ekō informs the largest-ever case on data protection in Brazil. He has been invited to address the United Nation’s Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Organization of American States’ Office of the Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression. Previously, he was a law clerk and practiced in Brazil, advising technology companies on data protection and intellectual property."

    "title": "Lawful Surveillance Protocols, Crypto Wars, and the Limitations of Privacy as Security",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article revisits the “crypto wars” and the recurrent debates over exceptional access to encrypted data. From the Clipper Chip to Apple’s San Bernardino confrontation and beyond, policymakers and technologists traditionally framed encryption as a clash between privacy and security. Recent scholarship, however, reframes the conflict as one of security vs. security, emphasizing that undermining encryption weakens the very systems on which state and individual safety depend. Building on this reframing, the article surveys and critically evaluates proposals for “lawful surveillance protocols,” which attempt to reconcile privacy and law enforcement needs through cryptographic design. It argues that the prevailing conception of privacy as security, while strategically powerful, is incomplete. The article shows that a purely security-centered account fails to capture what is at stake in encryption regulation. It concludes that a fuller articulation of the right to privacy is needed to guide future debates and technical research."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The right to privacy is at a crossroads. It was once the subject of intense theoretical disputations; a pragmatic turn thrust it into the spotlight of the most salient disputes about the regulation of technology, surveillance, and informational capitalism. Yet at the same time that privacy law’s reach has become vast, there is no agreement on whether and how it can actually provide the answers that society expects to the most pressing questions of our days. If anything, the agreement increasingly seems to be that it can’t. The most exciting paths now being chartered instead are perhaps best read as moving “beyond privacy” and towards “data governance”. This chapter tracks this trajectory of the right to privacy, focusing on informational privacy. It raises questions we might want to answer before abandoning it as an old toy and discusses potential problems and limitations for data governance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Frontier AI models form associations that are opaque to humans. This complexity underlies impressive capabilities but also creates risk and undermines reliability. Scalable oversight in model design addresses those issues. It starts from the premise that, as models grow more capable, direct human judgment becomes less effective. In short, human supervision will not scale. The strategy is to enlist AI to oversee AI while keeping humans in control. The key is a hierarchy of models: less capable, more interpretable systems that developers can understand and use to evaluate stronger models.\nWe contribute to this discussion by asking how law can respond to and capitalize on scalable oversight. We outline what scalable regulatory oversight could look like in emerging regimes. We examine whether scalable oversight can complement or supplement human-in-the-loop requirements, which are now framed as direct human review. Finally, we show how scalable oversight can mitigate the information and resource deficits that have driven regulators to adopt corporate risk management approaches."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Supporters of proposals targeting anonymity sometimes argue that requiring users to make themselves known will remedy many of the pathologies afflicting the digital public sphere, including misinformation. Identification is seen as a tool for creating a more truth-based discourse by inducing speakers to behave more responsibly, as well as providing listeners with information to assess the credibility of the speaker. The assumption often is that anonymity promotes lies and incivility, while identification induces truth and civility. Nathaniel Persily sums it up: “If online anonymity is the cause of many of the democracy-related ills of social media, then disclosure might be the best disinfectant.”\nIn fact, in an environment beset by political polarization, instead of serving as a disinfectant, identification can add fuel to the fire of mis- and disinformation. Not only that, anonymity can have a role also in enabling public political deliberation that has been underappreciated. This paper surveys literature from multiple disciplines and challenges assumptions behind the prevailing stances towards anonymity and mis- and disinformation. It argues that anonymity and identification do not have a fixed function; it instead refers to the plurality of identification and the plurality of anonymity. “Plurality” is meant to emphasize that both anonymity and identification shape and are shaped by factors such as social norms and platform affordances. As such, whether identification will contribute to a more truth-based public discourse and to a more civic-minded digital sphere is a question that can only be answered if we account for those factors. Considering the identity-based components of the spread of disinformation in polarized contexts, anonymity can serve as a device to create opportunities for conversation and avoid some of the mechanisms triggering those components."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Platforms have too much power over social media. Yet the two opposing paths to reform misdiagnose the problem and pose a dilemma. Eliminate platform power (Texas’ approach, at display in Moody) and jeopardize user speech, or resign to platform rule and seek to improve it (the EU’s influential approach).\nTo thread through this dilemma, we can learn from the structural constitution—and conquer power by dividing it. Answer platform power, this Article argues, by building collective user power. It calls for using regulatory subsidies to redistribute, to user communities, authority now enjoyed by companies. The Article shows that countervailing power is key to understanding that the First Amendment is not categorically anti-redistributive. Instead, properly understood, it scrutinizes redistribution to preserve the independence of public opinion— the people’s “censorial power”, which the First Amendment itself counters against government power.\nAs a prototype of countervailing platform power, this Article offers federalism. Governance is split into platform-wide (“federal”) and community (“state”) tiers. User communities gain primary authority over content policies and amplification priorities, as well as interface design. Platforms keep limited, enumerated powers over system-wide concerns and specified violations. A platform compact achieved through collective bargaining between users and platforms sets the boundaries. The resulting framework allows for lawful-content limitations legitimate as expressions of user deliberation, while addressing dangerous and toxic renegade communities. The model is not a silver bullet for content moderation, but it allows decisions to be made without concentrated political power in the hands of a few company executives."
